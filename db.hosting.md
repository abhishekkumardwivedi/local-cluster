### Few of the informations:

**Key-value:** Key-value databases are highly partition-able and allow horizontal scaling at scales that other types of databases cannot achieve. Use cases such as gaming, ad tech, and IoT lend themselves particularly well to the key-value data model. DynamoDB is designed to provide consistent single-digit millisecond latency for any scale of workloads.

**Document:** In application code, data is represented often as an object or JSON-like document because it is an efficient and intuitive data model for developers. Document databases make it easier for developers to store and query data in a database by using the same document model format that they use in their application code. The flexible, semi-structured, and hierarchical nature of documents and document databases allows them to evolve with applications’ needs. The document model works well.

with catalogs, user profiles, and content management systems where each document is unique and evolves over time.

**Graph:** A graph database’s purpose is to make it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected data sets. Typical use cases for a graph database include social networking, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and knowledge graphs.
**Neo4J** is a great graph implementation for relationional db.

**In-memory:** Gaming and ad-tech applications have use cases such as leader boards, session stores, and real-time analytics that require microsecond response times and can have large spikes in traffic coming at any time.

**Search:** Many applications output logs to help developers troubleshoot issues.  **Elastic-search** Service is purpose built for providing near-real-time visualizations and analytics of machine-generated data by indexing, aggregating, and searching semi structured logs and metrics. Elastic-search also is a powerful, high-performance search engine for full-text search use cases.

**SQL:** Everyone noes it, no introduction but but few of the DBs are great implementations such as **InfluxDB**.

**Visulaizer:** Many of the DB comes with GUI for visulaization but framework like **Grafana** brings all in one table.
